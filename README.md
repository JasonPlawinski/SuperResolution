This repository is part of the work I did during my year at Osaka University
with the exchange program with FrontierLab@OsakaU. It was also presented at 
MIRU 2018 in Sapporo on August 8th during the poster session.
The work was done with the supervision and valuable help of Matsushita Yasuyuki
and Michael Waechter.

This repositery contains the script for training different type of Super 
Resolution algorithm. A script for generating High resolution images from a 
pretrained network. Pretrained Networks. The Texture Data set used for training.
The poster and the extended abstract presented at MIRU are also available.
